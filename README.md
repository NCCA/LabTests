# Linux Lab install test suite

The following programs are going to be a test suite for the various libraries we use on the NCCA linux build.

Eventually a single make test will allow for automated testing of everything for now it will have to be done manually whilst I write the code etc.

Will require that gtest is installed on the system, will also use Qt / qmake
